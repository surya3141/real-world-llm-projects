ðŸš€ **Embarking on a 50-Day AI Challenge: From Data Scientist to AI Systems Builder**

After 3+ years as a Data Scientist at Mahindra & Mahindra working with traditional ML, I'm taking on a new challenge that's pushing me into the world of production-ready LLM systems.

I recently came across an inspiring Instagram post by Sri Nithya Thimmaraju (@techwithnt) sharing a comprehensive roadmap for building real-world AI solutions. It resonated deeply with meâ€”so I decided to implement all four projects and document the journey.

**The Challenge: 4 Projects Addressing AI's Biggest Limitations**

ðŸ”¹ **Self-Correcting RAG Pipeline** â†’ Solving hallucination (85% reduction)
ðŸ”¹ **Multi-Agent Workflow Automator** â†’ Specialization beats generalization
ðŸ”¹ **Niche Fine-Tuned Model** â†’ 8B models beating GPT-4 at 5% cost
ðŸ”¹ **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation** â†’ Measuring subjective quality at scale

**Why This Matters:**
â€¢ Hallucination rates in standard RAG: 40-60%
â€¢ Companies spending $50K-$200K monthly on GPT-4 for tasks specialized models could handle at 1/20th cost
â€¢ Most teams evaluate with "vibes" instead of systematic metrics

**What I'm Learning:**
Moving from scikit-learn and traditional ML to LangChain, CrewAI, vector databases, and fine-tuning workflows. It's a steep curve, but that's where growth happens.

ðŸ“– **I've written a detailed article** breaking down:
â€¢ The problem with today's AI hype
â€¢ Why these 4 projects form the pillars of production AI
â€¢ My background and why I'm taking this on
â€¢ What you'll learn following this journey

ðŸ‘‰ **Read the full article on Medium:** [INSERT MEDIUM LINK]

Over the next 7 weeks, I'll be publishing detailed implementation guides for each projectâ€”architecture, code, benchmarks, and lessons learned.

**Article 2 drops Sunday, Nov 3** â†’ Deep dive into building the Self-Correcting RAG Pipeline
