---

## Step 2: Generate Your Post (Script Method)

### Basic Usage
```bash
python generate_linkedin_post.py ../articles/article-01-introduction.md
```
Output: `article-01-introduction-linkedin-post.md`

### Choose a Style
```bash
# Technical deep-dive

# Personal story
python generate_linkedin_post.py ../articles/your-article.md --style story

# Provocative question
python generate_linkedin_post.py ../articles/your-article.md --style question
```

### Preview First
```bash
python generate_linkedin_post.py ../articles/your-article.md --preview
```

---

## Step 3: Customize Your Post

Open the generated file and replace these placeholders:

### 1. Hook (Lines 1-3)
**Replace:** `[ATTENTION-GRABBING HOOK]`

**With Examples:**
```markdown
🚨 Standard RAG systems hallucinate 40-60% of the time. I just built a solution that reduces this to 3%.

🤔 Why is Nvidia worth $5 trillion while other chip makers struggle?

📊 Companies waste $50K monthly on GPT-4 for tasks a $200 model handles better.
```

### 2. Medium Link
**Replace:** `[INSERT YOUR MEDIUM LINK]`

**With:** Your actual Medium article URL
```markdown
👉 Read the full article: https://medium.com/@yourusername/article-title-xyz
```

### 3. Key Insight
**Replace:** `[Share one memorable takeaway from the article]`

**With:** Your best insight from the article
```markdown
**My Key Insight:**

Architecture beats model size. A well-designed 8B model system outperforms raw GPT-4 calls. System design matters more than model parameters.
```

### 4. Discussion Question
**Replace:** `[Ask an engaging question related to the article topic]`

**With:** An open-ended question
```markdown
💭 What's been your biggest challenge with RAG systems? Hallucinations? Cost? Or retrieval quality?
```

### 5. Hashtags
**Replace:** `#[AddRelevantTags]`

**With:** 8-12 relevant hashtags
```markdown
#AI #MachineLearning #RAG #LLM #DataScience #ProductionAI #MLOps #TechArticle
```

---

## Step 4: Add a Visual

Create or find one of these:
- Key diagram from your article
- Data visualization/chart
- Before/after comparison
- Architecture diagram
- Results summary infographic

**Tools:**
- Canva (easy templates)
- Figma (custom designs)
- Excalidraw (quick diagrams)

---

## Step 5: Post on LinkedIn

### When to Post
- **Best time:** 8:00-10:00 AM in your timezone
- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Avoid:** Monday morning, Friday afternoon

### How to Post
1. Open LinkedIn
2. Click "Start a post"
3. Paste your customized content
4. Upload your visual
5. Review preview (especially mobile view)
6. Click "Post" or "Schedule"

---

## Step 6: Engage (Critical!)

### First 2 Hours
✅ Respond to EVERY comment
✅ Ask follow-up questions
✅ Like and thank commenters
✅ Share in 2-3 relevant groups

### Why This Matters
LinkedIn algorithm prioritizes posts with early engagement. Your first 2 hours determine if the post goes viral or flops.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Generic hook** - "Check out my article..."
✅ **Specific hook** - "Standard RAG systems hallucinate 40-60%..."

❌ **No value stated** - Just sharing a link
✅ **Clear value** - "Learn how to reduce costs 95%..."

❌ **No engagement question** - Post ends with CTA
✅ **Engagement question** - "What's your experience?"

❌ **Too many hashtags** - 20+ tags
✅ **Right amount** - 8-12 relevant tags

❌ **Post and ghost** - No comment responses
✅ **Active engagement** - Reply to everyone

## Pro Tips

### 🎯 Hook Formula
```
[Shocking stat] + [Who should care] + [Why now]

Example:
"85% of RAG systems hallucinate daily. If you're building AI products, you need to know this."
```

### 💡 Engagement Formula
```
[Problem] → [Your solution] → [Results] → [Question]

Example:
"RAG hallucinated → Built 3-agent system → 85% reduction → What's your approach?"
```

### 📊 Visual Formula
```
Before | After | Improvement
  40%  →   3%  → 93% better
```
