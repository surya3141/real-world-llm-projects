üí° **Article 4/6: I Fine-Tuned Llama 3 8B and It Beat GPT-4 at 5% of the Cost**

"Just use GPT-4" they said.
"Open source models can't compete" they said.

They were wrong.

For specialized tasks, a fine-tuned 8B model can outperform GPT-4‚Äîwhile costing 95% less.

**The Experiment:**

I fine-tuned Llama 3 8B on curated Python API documentation to create a specialized coding assistant.

**Task:** Generate accurate API documentation and code examples

**The Results:**

üìä **Llama 3 8B Fine-Tuned**
‚Ä¢ Accuracy: 91%
‚Ä¢ Cost per 1K requests: $0.50
‚Ä¢ Response time: 1.2s
‚Ä¢ Inference: Self-hosted

üìä **GPT-4 Baseline**
‚Ä¢ Accuracy: 78%
‚Ä¢ Cost per 1K requests: $10.00
‚Ä¢ Response time: 2.5s
‚Ä¢ Dependency: OpenAI API

**The fine-tuned model won on every metric.**

**How I Did It:**

üîß **Data Curation** (The 80% that matters)
‚Üí Scraped official Python docs
‚Üí Created instruction-tuning dataset (Q&A pairs)
‚Üí Quality over quantity: 5K high-quality examples

‚öôÔ∏è **Training with Unsloth + LoRA**
‚Üí Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
‚Üí 4-bit quantization for efficiency
‚Üí Trained on single GPU in 6 hours
‚Üí Total cost: $8 (compute)

üìà **Evaluation Framework**
‚Üí Compared base model vs fine-tuned vs GPT-4
‚Üí Metrics: Accuracy, hallucination rate, API correctness
‚Üí Human evaluation for code quality

**Key Learnings:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Quality > Model Size** ‚Üí 5K curated examples beat 70B params with generic training

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Specialization Wins** ‚Üí Fine-tuned 8B knows Python APIs better than general-purpose GPT-4

3Ô∏è‚É£ **LoRA is Magic** ‚Üí Train only 0.1% of parameters, keep 99% frozen, get massive improvements

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Cost at Scale** ‚Üí 1M API calls = $500 (fine-tuned) vs $10,000 (GPT-4)

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Ownership Matters** ‚Üí Self-hosted = no vendor lock-in, full control

**When to Fine-Tune vs Use GPT-4:**

‚úÖ **Fine-Tune When:**
‚Ä¢ Specialized domain with available data
‚Ä¢ High volume usage (cost matters)
‚Ä¢ Need predictable behavior/control
‚Ä¢ Sensitive data (keep it private)

‚ùå **Use GPT-4 When:**
‚Ä¢ General reasoning across diverse topics
‚Ä¢ Low volume usage
‚Ä¢ Prototyping/rapid iteration
‚Ä¢ Latest capabilities needed

**Technical Stack:**
‚Ä¢ Llama 3 8B base model
‚Ä¢ Unsloth for efficient fine-tuning
‚Ä¢ LoRA/PEFT for parameter efficiency
‚Ä¢ Hugging Face Transformers
‚Ä¢ Custom evaluation scripts

üìñ **Full article includes:**
‚Ä¢ Step-by-step data curation process
‚Ä¢ Training configuration and hyperparameters
‚Ä¢ Detailed benchmark results
‚Ä¢ Cost-benefit analysis
‚Ä¢ Deployment strategies
‚Ä¢ MLOps workflow

**The Bottom Line:**
Fine-tuning open source models isn't just viable‚Äîit's often superior for specialized use cases. You can build competitive AI assets without spending $200K/year on API calls.

üí≠ **Poll Question:** Have you fine-tuned an open source model for production use?
‚Ä¢ Yes, and it outperformed proprietary models
‚Ä¢ Yes, but results were underwhelming
‚Ä¢ No, but planning to
‚Ä¢ No, sticking with APIs
