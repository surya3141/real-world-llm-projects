- Temporary drafts you'll move later
- Testing without cluttering the main directory

---

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's a complete workflow from article to published post:

### Step 1: Generate Initial Draft
```bash
python generate_linkedin_post.py ../articles/article-02-self-correcting-rag.md
```

### Step 2: Review Generated File
```bash
cat article-02-self-correcting-rag-linkedin-post.md
```

### Step 3: Customize the Post

Open the file and edit:

**Before:**
```markdown
üöÄ **[ATTENTION-GRABBING HOOK]**

[Replace with your hook - Use the template guide for ideas]
```

**After:**
```markdown
üöÄ **Standard RAG systems hallucinate 40-60% of the time. I just built a solution that reduces this to 3%.**

As a Data Scientist at Mahindra & Mahindra, I've seen firsthand how hallucinations destroy user trust in AI systems.
```

### Step 4: Add Your Medium Link

**Before:**
```markdown
üëâ **Read the full article on Medium:** [INSERT YOUR MEDIUM LINK]
```

**After:**
```markdown
üëâ **Read the full article on Medium:** https://medium.com/@arulsurya05/self-correcting-rag-pipeline-xyz
```

### Step 5: Customize Key Insight

**Before:**
```markdown
**My Key Insight:**

[Share one memorable takeaway from the article]
```

**After:**
```markdown
**My Key Insight:**

Architecture beats model size. A well-designed three-agent system outperforms raw GPT-4 calls for factual accuracy. System design matters more than model parameters.
```

### Step 6: Add Discussion Question

**Before:**
```markdown
üí≠ **Question for the community:**

[Ask an engaging question related to the article topic]

What's your experience with this? Share your thoughts below! üëá
```

**After:**
```markdown
üí≠ **Question for the community:**

What's been your biggest challenge with RAG systems? Hallucinations? Cost? Or retrieval quality?

Have you tried multi-agent architectures? Share your experience below! üëá
```

### Step 7: Adjust Hashtags

**Before:**
```markdown
#AI #MachineLearning #DataScience #TechArticle #Medium #[AddRelevantTags]
```

**After:**
```markdown
#AI #MachineLearning #RAG #LLM #DataScience #ProductionAI #MLOps #Hallucinations #LangChain #TechArticle
```

### Step 8: Add Visual Asset

Prepare a visual (diagram, chart, or infographic) to include with the post.

### Step 9: Schedule Post

- Copy final content to LinkedIn
- Add visual asset
- Schedule for 8:00 AM on Tuesday or Wednesday
- Set reminder to engage in first 2 hours

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Script Not Finding Article
```bash
‚ùå Error: Article not found: ../articles/article-01.md
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use absolute path or verify relative path
python generate_linkedin_post.py /full/path/to/article.md

# Or check you're in the right directory
pwd  # Should show: .../linkedin-posts
```

### Problem: Poor Key Points Extraction
The script extracts weird content as key points.

**Solution:**
- Manually edit the generated post
- Focus on customizing hook, problems, and key insight
- Use the template guide for better structure

### Problem: Not Enough Metrics Found
Script finds 0-1 metrics from your article.

**Solution:**
- Manually add metrics from your article
- Look for percentages, cost savings, time improvements
- Add them to the "Key Results" section

### Problem: Generated Post Too Generic
Output looks too template-like.

**Solution:**
- This is expected - the script creates a starting point
- Use it as a draft, not final content
- Invest time in customizing hook, insight, and question
- Review LINKEDIN-POST-TEMPLATE.md for best practices

---

## Advanced Usage

### Integrate with CI/CD

Create new posts automatically when articles are added:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .github/workflows/generate-linkedin-posts.sh

for article in articles/article-*.md; do
    basename=$(basename "$article" .md)
    output="linkedin-posts/${basename}-auto-generated.md"
    
    if [ ! -f "$output" ]; then
        python linkedin-posts/generate_linkedin_post.py "$article" --output "$output"
        echo "Generated: $output"
    fi
done
```

### Create Custom Templates

Extend the script by modifying the template methods:

```python
# Add to generate_linkedin_post.py

def _generate_custom_post(self) -> str:
    """Generate a custom style post."""
    # Your custom template logic
    pass
```
