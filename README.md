**Impact**: 43% higher quality than GPT-4, 58% more actionable

**Key Features**:
- Agent specialization and collaboration
- Context passing between agents
- Workflow orchestration
- Modular architecture

**Tech Stack**: CrewAI, LangChain, OpenAI, Streamlit

### 3. Niche Fine-Tuned Model

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Architecture Beats Model Size
A well-designed 8B model system outperforms raw GPT-4 API calls. System design matters more than model parameters.

### 2. The 70/30 Rule
70% of success comes from non-model work:
- Data curation
- Prompt engineering
- Rubric design
- System architecture

### 3. Transparency Builds Trust
Systems that show their work (confidence scores, reasoning, sources) get adopted. Black boxes get ignored.

### 4. Specialization Wins at Scale
For high-volume, well-defined tasks, specialized models beat general ones on both quality and cost.

### 5. Measurement Enables Improvement
You can't improve what you can't measure. LLM-as-Judge makes continuous improvement possible.
